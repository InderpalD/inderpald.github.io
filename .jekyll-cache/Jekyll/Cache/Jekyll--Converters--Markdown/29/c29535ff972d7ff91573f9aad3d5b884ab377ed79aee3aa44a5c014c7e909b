I"ä<p>Code coverage is measured with respect to the individual lines of code.</p>

<p>Yes, each line.</p>

<p>There are syntax lines such as those that contain curly braces.</p>

<p>Then there are logic lines and branch lines consisting of for loop declerations,
if statements, assignments, calculations, and so onâ€¦</p>

<p>A simple formula for calculating code coverages is as follows:</p>

<p>code_coverage = non-syntax lines with tests / all non-syntax lines</p>
