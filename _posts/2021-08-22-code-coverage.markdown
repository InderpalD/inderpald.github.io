Code coverage is measured with respect to the individual lines of code.

Yes, each line.

There are syntax lines such as those that contain curly braces.

Then there are logic lines and branch lines consisting of for loop declerations,
if statements, assignments, calculations, and so on...

A simple formula for calculating code coverages is as follows:

code_coverage = non-syntax lines with tests / all non-syntax lines
